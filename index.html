		<p>">Welcome to my personal website. This is just the beginning of what will (hopefully) become a very clean, cool, and aesthetically pleasing page. I  haven't yet learned CSS, so this is what you are stuck with for now. I begin Startup Institute Boston on October 21st, so look for more changes then! Thanks for visiting.</p>
